# Document scripts here (what do they do, what order to run in, prerequisites, etc.)

- the 00_exploration.R script was used for demonstrating RStudio-GitHub integration. Can be modified for any data exploration.

- the 01_combine_files.R script has a suggested workflow for combining individual survey files into a single data frame. The code needs to be modified in order to actually run.
